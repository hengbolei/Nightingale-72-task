# Development and Operation

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- Node.js for JavaScript syntax checks
- Optional PostgreSQL 14+ for durable/RLS validation
- Optional approved OpenAI project key for AI summary and transcription validation

All bundled data is synthetic. Development defaults to the in-memory adapter and resets clinical
state when the application process restarts.

## Installation and start

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn nightingale.main:app --reload
```

Open:

- Application: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- OpenAPI UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`

## Development accounts

The browser signs in through `/api/auth/login`; actor IDs, roles, and clinic IDs are not supplied
by client headers. Development-only credentials are:

| Role | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patient | `patient` | `patient-demo-2026` |
| Staff | `staff` | `staff-demo-2026` |
| Clinician | `clinician` | `clinician-demo-2026` |
| Admin | `admin` | `admin-demo-2026` |

Example cookie-backed API session:

```powershell
$session = New-Object Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login" `
  -WebSession $session `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"username":"clinician","password":"clinician-demo-2026"}'

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/patients/20000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001" `
  -WebSession $session
```

Sessions are signed, expire, can be revoked on logout, and reject an interactive `system` role.
When PostgreSQL is enabled, active account membership is checked and hashed session IDs persist.

## Optional PostgreSQL and production settings

Copy `.env.example` into your secret-management workflow; do not commit populated secrets. The
important settings are:

- `NIGHTINGALE_DATABASE_URL`: enables the encrypted PostgreSQL adapter and RLS migration;
- `NIGHTINGALE_TOKEN_SECRET`: signs session tokens;
- `NIGHTINGALE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: protects clinical snapshots and cold archives;
- `NIGHTINGALE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: must be HTTPS in production;
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: explicitly enables external summary/transcription calls; and
- `NIGHTINGALE_OPENAI_MODEL`: selects the Responses API model.

Production mode refuses to start without the database URL, signing secret, encryption key, and an
HTTPS public URL. Use a non-superuser PostgreSQL application role that cannot bypass RLS. The
included migration is `migrations/001_postgres_rls.sql`; the reverse-proxy baseline is
`deploy/nginx.conf`.

No target PostgreSQL, TLS certificate, KMS, WORM audit store, or approved OpenAI key is bundled.
Those environment-gated integrations must be validated before production use.

## PHI and model boundary

`PHIRedactionGateway` is called by the text-summary adapter before an external request. It removes
known patient names/MRNs and supported ID/phone patterns. The request uses `store=false`; the
generated entry remains AI-suggested.

Audio transcription currently sends audio to the configured external transcription endpoint
before text redaction is possible. Treat this as a documented prototype limitation. Clinical
deployment requires approved local/on-premises ASR or a compliant covered transcription service.

## Verification

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe -q
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check .
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format --check src tests scripts
node --check src/nightingale/static/api.js
node --check src/nightingale/static/app.js
node --check src/nightingale/static/service-worker.js
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\benchmark_glance.py --iterations 1000 --warmup 100
```

The current local baseline is 45 passing tests. The performance result is specific to the
single-patient in-memory adapter and is not a production capacity claim.
